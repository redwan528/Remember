# Remember Card Game iOS App

## Overview
"Remember" is a dynamic and engaging iOS card matching game developed as part of my learning journey in iOS development. This project demonstrates proficiency in Swift, SwiftUI, and applying the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern. The game features multiple themes, intuitive UI, and a scoring system, offering a fun and interactive way to test memory skills.

## Features
- **Dynamic Themes**: Supports over six distinct themes, each with a unique set of emojis, card count, and color scheme.
- **Randomized Gameplay**: Each new game randomly selects a theme and shuffles the cards to ensure a fresh experience every time.
- **Scoring System**: Implements a sophisticated scoring mechanism that rewards matches and penalizes mismatches, including tracking previously seen cards.
- **UI Design**: Sleek and user-friendly interface with theme name display and real-time score tracking.
- **New Game Functionality**: Includes a "New Game" button allowing users to restart the game at any time.
- **Efficient Code Structure**: Codebase is structured using the MVVM pattern, ensuring clean separation of concerns and maintainability.

## Technical Aspects
- **Swift and SwiftUI**: Written entirely in Swift and designed using SwiftUI, showcasing modern iOS development practices.
- **MVVM Architecture**: Utilizes the Model-View-ViewModel architecture for efficient data handling and UI updates.
- **Theme Management**: Themes are managed efficiently, allowing easy addition of new themes with minimal code changes.
- **Randomized Theme and Card Selection**: Ensures a diverse range of emojis are used without repetition, enhancing the gameplay experience.
